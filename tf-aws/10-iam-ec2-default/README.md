# Introduction

* IAM role canâ€™t be directly attached to an EC2 instance. Therefore, first instance profile needs to be created with the role and then the instance profile is attached to an instance.
* When using the IAM console to create an IAM role for EC2, an instance profile with the same name is created.
* Using CLI, SDKs , Terraform and CloudFormation, needs roles and instance profiles to be created separately.
* After an instance profile is created with a role, It can be attached to an instance.
* An instance profile can only have one role at a time. However, one role can belong to multiple instance profiles.
