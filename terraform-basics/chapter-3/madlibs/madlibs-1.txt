THE OBSERVATORY

Out class when on a field trip to a CHUBBY observatory. It
was located on top of a MILK, and it looked like a giant
ARMY with a slit down its WALNUTS. We went inside and
looked through a ZEUS and were able to see BANANAs in
the sky that were millions of JELLYFISHs away. The men and
women who KICKED in the observatory are called
SANDWICHs, and they are always watching for comets, eclipses,
and shooting VIOLINs. An eclipse occurs when a CAT
comes between the earth and the JIGSAW and everything
gets THUNDERING. Next week, we place to BAKED the
Museum of Modern PANTHER.
