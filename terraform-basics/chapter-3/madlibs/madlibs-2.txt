HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER

Many BITTER photographers make big money
photographing MILKs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to ABUNDANT magazines or to agencies who use
them in ZEUS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PANTHER camera. You also need an
GRUMPY meter and filters and a special close-up
CAT. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary VIOLINs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very DELICATELY for at
least 73 years.
